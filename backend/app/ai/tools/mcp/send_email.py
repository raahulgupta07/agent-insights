"""MCP Tool: send_email - email the requesting user a summary or export.

The recipient is ALWAYS the authenticated token user — there is no recipient
argument — so an external MCP client can only ever email that user their own
data, never a third party. Attachments are scoped to a report the user's org
owns (verified here before resolution), mirroring the internal send_email tool.

Hidden from ``tools/list`` when SMTP isn't configured (``is_available``), so we
never advertise a tool that can only fail.
