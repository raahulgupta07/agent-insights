        "Generate a report with a line chart of the stock price of Tesla" -> Tesla Stock Price
        "Generate a report with a scatter plot of the relationship between age and income" -> Age vs Income
        "Generate a report with a heatmap of the correlation between different stocks" -> Stock Correlation
        "Generate a list of customers who have bought the most from us" -> Top Customers
        "Reconcile inventory between our system and our warehouse" -> Inventory Reconciliation
