"""Shared base-URL derivation for routes that build externally-visible URLs.

Used by /mcp (OAuth WWW-Authenticate metadata URLs), /excel (Office add-in
manifest URLs), and /.well-known/oauth-* endpoints. All three need to
return the URL the *client* sees, not the internal upstream URL uvicorn
sees, so they need to honor X-Forwarded-* when running behind a reverse
proxy (Caddy, ALB, etc.).

Priority:
  1. dash_config.base_url (operator-configured — always wins if set to a
     real value). The default ``http://0.0.0.0:3000`` (and the legacy
     ``http://0.0.0.0:8000``) is treated as "unconfigured".
  2. X-Forwarded-Proto + X-Forwarded-Host (set by reverse proxies; for
     comma-separated chains we take the leftmost = the external client).
  3. The request's own scheme/Host header (fallback for direct dev
     connections without a proxy).
