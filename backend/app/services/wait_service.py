"""Wait service — one-shot "pause then resume" for the agent loop.

The ``wait`` tool ends the current agent turn (like clarify) and arms a *single*
APScheduler ``date`` job through this service. When the job fires, the agent is
resumed on the SAME report by creating a fresh completion whose prompt is the
``reason`` the agent gave when it paused. Full conversation history reloads
automatically, so it can retry exactly where it left off.

This is deliberately NOT a scheduled task:
  - one-shot (``trigger='date'``), never recurring;
  - no user-visible ``ScheduledPrompt`` row — the only record is the ``wait``
    tool execution, which the UI already renders;
  - it self-deletes after firing once.

It reuses the shared scheduler (``app.core.scheduler``) and the cross-worker
run-claim so a fire executes exactly once across uvicorn workers / replicas.

NOTE: the job callable is the MODULE-LEVEL ``run_wait_wake`` function, not a
bound method. APScheduler's ``SQLAlchemyJobStore`` serializes the callable by
import path; a bound method deserializes without ``self`` and would crash on
fire after a restart. A module-level function round-trips cleanly.
