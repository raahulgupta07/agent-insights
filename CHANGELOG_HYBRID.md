# What's new — CityAgent Analytics

Hybrid feature changelog (our additions on top of the bagofwords/Dash base). Newest first.
Format per entry: `## v<semver> — <title>  (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` then bullets.
Bullet rules (this is the user-facing "What's new" feed):
  - **Top-level** `- ` bullets are USER-FACING — plain language, no file paths / jargon / markdown.
    These show in the in-app "What's new" popover.
  - **Indented** `  - ` bullets are TECHNICAL detail — file paths, flags, internals.
    Hidden from the popover; shown collapsed on the full /changelog page only.
Every shipped feature bumps `VERSION_HYBRID` and adds an entry here.

## v1.33.1 — Settings layout flush + rail dedupe + LLM two-section split  (2026-06-26)
- The Settings pages now sit flush against the left menu with the same even gap as every other page (they used to float centered with a big empty band between the menu and the panel).
- The Settings menu no longer shows "Integrations" twice — Channels, Folder Sync and SMTP are now grouped together under one Integrations heading.
- The LLM settings page is split into two clear sections: "Preconfigured" (the ready-to-use models we ship) and "Your models" (anything you connect with your own provider and key).
  - `layouts/settings.vue`: dropped `flex justify-center`/`max-w-7xl`/`items-center` → standard page shell (`bg-[#F1ECE3] h-full overflow-hidden flex flex-col` + card `my-2 me-2 flex-1 overflow-y-auto`) so the card is flush after AppRail.
  - `useAppNav.ts`: reordered `settingsTabs` so `smtp` sits next to `integrations`/`folder-sync` → the section eyebrow no longer repeats (eyebrow renders on section *change*; SMTP after the SECURITY group caused a 2nd INTEGRATIONS header).
  - `components/LLMsComponent.vue`: `preconfiguredModels`/`customModels` computeds split by `isPreconfigured = is_default || is_small_default || model_id ∈ PRECONFIGURED_MODEL_IDS` (the seed_openrouter.py set: haiku-4.5, sonnet-4.6, sonnet-4, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-5.4-mini). Two band-pill section cards; custom section shows a dashed add-state when empty. FE-only split — keep the id set in sync with the seed, or add a backend `is_preconfigured` flag for durability.

## v1.33.0 — Overview design + studio-scroll across the app, report panel polish  (2026-06-26)
- Every Build, Manage and Settings page (plus all Workspace tabs and Monitoring) now wears the same Overview look — serif title, rounded cream card, section cards and toolbars — so the whole app reads as one design.
- The left menu and page card now scroll like the Agent Studio: the menu stays put with its own scroll, the page scrolls inside its rounded card, and there's an even 8px gap on every side that never disappears. The menu card also fills the full height instead of stopping short.
- Follow-up question chips under a report now fit their text, line up on the left, wrap long questions onto multiple lines, and are never cut off — in both the split view and the docked view.
- The report's Outputs panel shows three cards per row (Dashboard · Report · Slides · Excel · Infographic · Insight Map) with Forecast and Anomaly as "Soon" cards, and the data-source list scrolls on its own so the whole panel fits one screen.
- Opening a dashboard or infographic in full screen now fills the screen instead of showing a tiny card in the corner.
- The artifact toolbar auto-fits — the version picker shrinks and the Share button stays visible instead of being clipped.
  - Reskin: subagent-applied Overview shell to `pages/{knowledge,memory,queries,evals,workflows}/index.vue`, `pages/{instructions,skills,connectors}.vue`; settings via `layouts/settings.vue`; monitoring via `layouts/monitoring.vue`. Lane accents per page.
  - Studio-scroll parity: `layouts/default.vue` right wrapper `overflow-y-auto`→`overflow-hidden`; each page root `min-h-full`→`h-full overflow-hidden flex flex-col`, card `flex-1`→`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`. `AppRail.vue` aside `h-full`→`self-stretch min-h-0` (replaced-flex collapse fix → full-height rail). Build/Manage/Settings got `railHeader` + per-item `section` in `useAppNav.ts` to trigger the studio card rail.
  - `ConsoleInstructions.vue` gained a `fill` prop (`h-[calc(100vh-100px)]`→`h-full min-h-0`) so it fills the page card; `pages/instructions.vue` drops the duplicate band-pill wrapper.
  - Follow-up chips: report chat root gets an always-on `.chat-pane` class; lifted the dock guards (`min-width:0`, `overflow-wrap`, table in-block scroll, `.dock-followups` auto-fit/left/wrap) from `.dash-dock`-only to `.chat-pane` so split view gets them too (`pages/reports/[id]/index.vue`).
  - Outputs panel: `grid-cols-2`→`grid-cols-3`, badges absolute, Forecast/Anomaly promoted to in-grid SOON cards; data-sources list `max-h-[150px] overflow-y-auto`.
  - `ArtifactFrame.vue`: fullscreen iframe `absolute inset-4 w-auto h-auto`→`w-full h-full` (iframe is a replaced element → `width:auto` ignored insets → collapsed to intrinsic 300×150). Toolbar `min-w-0`/`flex-1` on selector, `shrink-0` on action group → no Share clipping.

## v1.32.1 — Workspace Overview framing fix  (2026-06-26)
- The Workspace Overview now sits in its own rounded panel — matching curved corners, a soft border and an even gap on every side — so it pairs cleanly with the left menu instead of running flush to the window edge.
  - `pages/workspace/index.vue` root wrapped in the studio-main card (`my-2 me-2 px-6/8 py-6 bg-[#FBFAF6] border border-[#E9E0D3] rounded-2xl min-h-[calc(100%-1rem)]`) on a `#F1ECE3` cream gutter; removed the old `max-w-[1180px]` left-align that left a dead right gap. Full all-tabs design mock at `scratchpad/workspace-all-tabs.html` (Overview/Templates/Reports/Dashboards/Presentations/Spreadsheets/Scheduled).

## v1.32.0 — New Workspace Overview (Auto-pilot design)  (2026-06-26)
- Workspace now opens on a clean Overview that mirrors the agent Auto-pilot look: a quick "Create" row (new report · dashboard · import), your work organized into four colour-coded lanes (Reports · Dashboards · Presentations · Spreadsheets), and a Library & Schedule row (templates + scheduled). Everything you make shows up here automatically.
  - New `pages/workspace/index.vue` (readiness-style ring + `#2B2A26` numbered band pills + gradient create cards + 4 tinted lanes `#E7F1EB/#E4F0F4/#ECEAFB/#F6EEDD`, copied from the studio Auto-pilot tokens). Fail-soft fetch from existing endpoints (`/reports`, `/reports?has_artifacts=yes`, `/api/artifacts/presentations`, `/templates`, `/scheduled-tasks`). Added `overview` nav item (first in the Workspace group → `/workspace`).

## v1.31.1 — New brand logo across the app  (2026-06-26)
- The new circular City Holdings mark replaces the old gradient square — top nav (every page), login header, and the browser-tab favicon. Text stays "City Agent Insights".
  - Cropped icon from source → `public/assets/logo-mark*.png` + `logo-128.png` + `favicon.ico`/`favicon-32.png`/`apple-touch-icon.png`; TopNav `.cag-mark` + login header swapped CSS-gradient → `<img>`; favicon links added in `nuxt.config.ts`.
  - Dockerfile durable fix: frontend builder now uses `node:22-bookworm-slim` instead of the nodesource curl|bash apt install — kills the #1 cold-build failure (network download + OOM-from-apt). Fast FE deploy: host `yarn generate` + `docker cp .output/public/. ca-app:/app/frontend/dist` (ephemeral, no image rebuild).

## v1.31.0 — Identity Provider: one unified, add-driven list  (2026-06-26)
- The Identity Provider page is now one clean list. Nothing is preset — you start empty and click "Add provider" to add Google, Microsoft, Okta, Keycloak, any OIDC, an LDAP / AD directory, or SCIM provisioning. No more rows sitting there disabled.
- "Add provider" sits at the top-right; LDAP and SCIM are added the same way as everything else.
- Every entry has the same controls: Configure, an on/off switch, and remove.
- Removing a provider now asks for confirmation (tick "I understand this can't be undone") so you can't delete one by accident.
- A "Save changes" button applies your on/off switches and auth-mode choice — flip things freely, then Save once. "Unsaved changes" shows when there's something to save.
- Removed the public sign-up toggle (no open registration from this page).
  - `pages/settings/identity-provider.vue` full rewrite → one `methods` computed merging kinds google/oidc/ldap/scim (only existing/added items shown). Add → `IdpProviderLibraryModal` (now 3 groups via `IDP_TEMPLATES.group`: social/directory/provisioning) → per-type config modal (Google `/sso/google`, OIDC `/sso/oidc` full-list, LDAP `LdapDirectoryModal`→`/enterprise/ldap/directories`, SCIM `useScimTokens`). Configure saves immediately; enable/disable + auth-mode are STAGED → `save()` batches PUT sso/oidc + sso/google + changed ldap dirs + sso/auth-mode, then reloads + clears dirty. Delete = double-confirm modal. Explicit imports (idp/ auto-import prefix landmine). Dropped the 4 fixed default rows, separate SCIM + LDAP sections, `useLdapSync`/single-`ldapForm`, public-signup. No backend change.

## v1.30.2 — Fix: LDAP directories panel now actually shows  (2026-06-26)
- The "LDAP / AD Directories" configuration (add/list/test directories) was invisible — now it renders under the LDAP Directory Sync section.
  - Root cause: Nuxt auto-imports `components/idp/*` with an `Idp` prefix, so `LdapDirectoriesPanel.vue`/`LdapDirectoryModal.vue` registered as `IdpLdapDirectoriesPanel`/`IdpLdapDirectoryModal`; the bare `<LdapDirectoriesPanel>` / `<LdapDirectoryModal>` tags resolved to nothing and rendered empty. Fix: explicit imports in `identity-provider.vue` and `LdapDirectoriesPanel.vue`.

## v1.30.1 — Removed the floating assistant robot  (2026-06-26)
- The floating robot widget in the bottom-right corner is gone from every screen.
  - Removed the global `<RobotAssistant />` mount (`app.vue`) and the `<AgentThinking />` mount + import (`layouts/default.vue`). Components left in the repo, just no longer rendered; activity-store mirrors that fed them are harmless no-ops.

## v1.30.0 — Multiple LDAP / AD directories + username login  (2026-06-26)
- You can now connect more than one LDAP / Active Directory — add as many directories as you need, each with its own enable switch, Test connection, and Delete.
- Sign-in setup is simpler: the default form asks only for the essentials (directory name, host, port, bind DN, bind password, base DN, user filter, email & name attribute). Everything else is tucked under "Advanced".
- Users sign in with their directory username (e.g. the `{username}` in your user filter, like sAMAccountName) — not only their email.
  - Storage: `config['ldap_directories']` list (each: id, name, enabled, logo, host, port, bind DN, Fernet bind pw, base DN, user_filter, email/name attr + advanced). Legacy single `config['ldap']` auto-migrates to one directory (id "default", host/port/ssl parsed from its url); legacy key left intact.
  - Backend: `find_user_by_username` ({username} filter, `escape_filter_chars`); `_build_server` host/port path; `get_effective_ldap_directories()` (DB-over-file, own session); login (`UserManager._do_authenticate`) iterates all enabled directories — username-first, email fallback, first success wins, all-unreachable → local break-glass, binds with the directory's email. Routes `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/POST-test /api/enterprise/ldap/directories[/{id}]` (EE-gated, manage_identity_providers). Passwords never returned (`bind_password_set` flag).
  - Frontend: `components/idp/LdapDirectoriesPanel.vue` (multi-directory list, per-row toggle/test/configure/delete + "Add LDAP / AD directory") + `LdapDirectoryModal.vue` (DocSensei-style default fields + Advanced collapsible). Replaces the single-LDAP row/modal in `identity-provider.vue`.

## v1.29.1 — Fix: LDAP / Active Directory login now actually uses your saved settings  (2026-06-26)
- LDAP sign-in was ignoring the directory you configured in Settings, so logins always fell back to local accounts. It now uses the saved LDAP/AD connection — directory users can sign in.
- LDAPS (secure) servers now connect correctly based on the server URL (ldaps://), even without a separate SSL switch.
  - Root cause: login (`core/auth.py`) read the static file config `settings.dash_config.ldap`, while the admin UI saves LDAP into `OrganizationSettings.config['ldap']` (DB). Admin "Test connection" worked (it read the DB), but actual login never did → `enabled` was always False → straight to local auth.
  - Fix: new `get_effective_ldap_config()` resolver (DB-over-file, own session, fail-soft) in `organization_settings_service.py`; `UserManager._do_authenticate`/`_ldap_authenticate` (core/auth.py) now resolve and pass the effective config instead of reading the file directly.
  - `LDAPConnectionManager._build_server` derives `use_ssl` from the URL scheme (ldaps:// → SSL, ldap:// → plain) since the modal has no SSL toggle — avoids the ldap3 "full ldaps:// URL + use_ssl=False" conflict that silently failed.

## v1.29.0 — Identity Provider: brand logos, on/off toggles, and a provider library  (2026-06-26)
- Every sign-in method (Google, Microsoft, Okta, Keycloak, OIDC, LDAP) now shows its real brand logo, on the settings page and on the login screen.
- Each method has a simple On/Off switch right in the list. Turn one on even before it's fully set up — it just shows an "On · Needs setup" note, and the login button errors politely until you finish.
- Okta and Keycloak are now ready-to-use options out of the box, and a new "Add provider" library lets you pick from Auth0, OneLogin, Ping, JumpCloud, AD FS, and more — each pre-filled so setup is faster.
- When configuring any connector (LDAP included) you can choose its logo from a built-in set or upload your own.
  - New `frontend/utils/idpLogos.ts` (preset brand SVGs + `idpLogoSvg`), `utils/idpTemplates.ts` (`IDP_TEMPLATES` catalog), `components/idp/IdpLogoPicker.vue` (v-model, preset grid + ≤300 KB upload→data URL), `components/idp/IdpProviderLibraryModal.vue` (`:open`/`@close`/`@select`).
  - `pages/settings/identity-provider.vue`: rows rebuilt as a `ssoRows` computed (Google · Microsoft · Okta · Keycloak defaults · custom OIDC) with logo + smart 4-state pill (`pillText`/`pillClass`) + inline quick-toggle (saves immediately) + library "Add provider"; logo picker added to every config modal. Okta/Keycloak/library picks flow through the existing shared OIDC modal (prefilled from a template); no bespoke modals.
  - `pages/users/sign-in.vue`: buttons render `idpLogoSvg(logo)` per provider (custom upload wins over brand default).
  - Backend: `logo: str` persisted on Google/OIDC/LDAP (`_clean_logo` = preset key OR `data:image/…` ≤400 KB, fail-soft ""), surfaced via `/sso` + `/api/settings` (`google_oauth.logo`, `oidc_providers[].logo`, `ldap_logo`). SCIM has no config object → no logo (cosmetic preset only).

## v1.28.0 — Login page shows only the sign-in methods you've enabled  (2026-06-26)
- The Google, Microsoft, SSO, Keycloak, and LDAP buttons on the login page now appear only when an admin has turned that method on in Settings → Identity Provider. Disabled methods are hidden — no more dead buttons.
- If you turn every external method off, the login page cleanly shows just the email/password form.
  - `/api/settings` now returns `ldap_enabled` (new `get_effective_ldap_enabled()` — DB org config overrides file, fail-soft False). Google + Microsoft + Keycloak already came through `oidc_providers` (Microsoft/Keycloak are stored as OIDC providers).
  - `pages/users/sign-in.vue`: per-button `v-if` on enabled state (`showGoogle/showMicrosoft/showKeycloak/showSSO/showLdap`); social + enterprise rows use dynamic `repeat(N,1fr)` columns so remaining buttons stay full-width; "OR CONTINUE WITH" divider + enterprise box hide when empty. No auth-logic change — authorize endpoints still enforce server-side.

## v1.27.0 — Tidier card buttons on Decks and Dashboards  (2026-06-26)
- The Open / Chat buttons on deck cards no longer wrap onto two lines — they sit flat and are the same size.
- The Chat / Dashboard buttons on dashboard cards are now exactly the same width.
  - Presentations cards (`pages/presentations/index.vue`): shortened labels (Open & generate → Generate, Open in chat → Chat), added `whitespace-nowrap` + `box-border` + `min-w-0` so the two-column grid buttons stay single-line and equal.
  - `components/home/RecentReportCard.vue` (Dashboards + Home grids): button CSS `flex: 1 1 0; width: 0; box-sizing: border-box; white-space: nowrap` so the bordered ghost and borderless primary render identical width.

## v1.26.0 — Channels: use the org default or a custom connection  (2026-06-26)
- For every channel (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, AI Mailbox, Telegram, MCP) you can now choose: use the organization's shared connection, or set up a custom one just for this agent — same choice you already have for Email.
- Channels default to the organization's connection, so an agent works out of the box with nothing to configure. Switch to "Custom for this agent" only when you want its own app, bot, or number.
- Removed the confusing "locked" message — replaced with a clear note that, whichever connection you pick, every channel still answers only from this agent's data.
  - `components/studio/StudioChannels.vue`: per-platform mode radio (global vs custom). Mode derived from data — a per-studio channel row = custom, none = org default; local override lets the user flip to custom before a row exists. Global branch shows an org-default note + "Remove custom" revert; custom branch keeps Set up/Reconfigure/Enable/Disable/Delete. Status chip is mode-aware (Org default / Connected / Not connected). No backend change — relies on existing NULL studio_id → org fallback.
- The "What's new" notes are now written in plain language instead of developer shorthand, so anyone can understand what changed.
- Curious about the deep technical details of a release? They're tucked under a "Technical details" toggle on the full What's new page.
  - Changelog parser (`backend/app/services/changelog.py`) splits bullets: top-level `- ` → `features` (user-facing, shown in popover), indented `  - ` → `details` (technical, hidden from popover).
  - Full page `pages/changelog/index.vue` renders `details` under a collapsed `<details>` toggle. Popover `WhatsNew.vue` unchanged (already renders `features` only). Recent entries (v1.20–1.24) rewritten plain + technical detail moved to indented bullets.

## v1.24.0 — Connect each agent to its own channels and email  (2026-06-26)
- Each agent now has its own Channels tab. Connect Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, an AI Mailbox, Telegram, or MCP to a single agent — pick a platform on the left, set it up on the right. Turn any channel on or off without touching your other agents.
- Each agent now has its own Email / SMTP tab. An agent can send its emails (shared results, scheduled reports, replies) using the company default, or you can give it its own mail server. A one-click "send test" confirms it works before you rely on it.
- The agent's left menu is now split into Access & Members, Channels, and Email / SMTP, so settings are easier to find.
- App updates ship faster — rebuilds are quicker behind the scenes.
  - Channels UI: `components/studio/StudioChannels.vue` — org-style two-pane picker (platform list + detail pane), reuses the Slack/Teams/WhatsApp/AI-Mailbox modals + Telegram/MCP. Per-platform status dot + set-up/reconfigure/enable/disable/delete, scoped to the studio.
  - Email UI: `components/studio/StudioEmail.vue` — mode radio (global default vs custom), custom fields mirror org SMTP (host/port/security/user/pass/from/validate-certs) + test. Stored in `Studio.config['smtp']` (Fernet password), no migration.
  - Backend: `email_client_resolver` per-agent SMTP tier (`get_studio_smtp` + `studio_smtp` precedence in `choose_outbound`; `resolve_outbound(..., studio_id=)`) wins over org/global. Routes `GET/PUT/POST-test /api/studios/{id}/smtp` (flag `HYBRID_AGENT_CHANNELS`, owner/editor). `studio_id` threaded through `notification_service`, `report.py` share, `email_send_service` replies. NULL studio / global mode = unchanged.
  - Dockerfile: dropped non-deterministic `apt-get upgrade -y` from builder stages (cache-stable); BuildKit cache mounts for Vite/Nuxt transform caches on `yarn generate`. Runtime `base` stage keeps its security upgrade.

## v1.23.0 — Faster dashboards on big results + agents answer in chat apps  (2026-06-26)
- Big result tables now load faster and take up far less storage, so dashboards built on large queries open quicker.
- Filter, sort, and page through large results live — only the rows you're looking at are fetched, even on millions of rows.
- Agents can now answer in Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, an AI Mailbox, Telegram, or MCP. A question coming from a channel is automatically answered using only that agent's data.
  - Parquet result storage: `backend/app/services/parquet_store.py` — results ≥`HYBRID_PARQUET_MIN_ROWS`=2000 rows offload to compressed Parquet on the `ca_uploads` volume instead of inline JSON in Postgres. Transparent hydrate on read; flag `HYBRID_PARQUET_RESULTS` default ON; crash-safe, fail-soft, daily purge GC. Docs: `docs/parquet-results.md`.
  - Interactive query endpoint `POST /steps/{id}/query`: allow-listed DuckDB pushdown (filter/group/agg/sort/page), returns slice + true total_rows, no raw SQL, limit cap 5000. Frontend `useStepQuery` + dashboard routes for `source:"parquet"` steps; inline steps keep client-side path.
  - Per-agent channels (flag `HYBRID_AGENT_CHANNELS` default ON): per-studio CRUD for all types (upsert, Fernet creds, audience). Inbound webhooks bind the report to the matched channel's `studio_id` → ReportService auto-scopes to that studio's sources. NULL studio_id = unchanged.
  - `scripts/safe-upgrade.sh` (NEW): guarded bake — rollback-tag image, backup DB+uploads together, health-gate, auto-rollback on failure.

## v1.22.0 — New look, now everywhere  (2026-06-26)
- The new warm look is now applied across the whole app — reports, chat, agents, monitoring, evals, templates, onboarding, sign-in, files, and shared/embedded pages all match.
- A visual refresh only — nothing about how the app works changed.
  - Completed the warm-palette rollout: 32 remaining pages + 148 components + 3 layouts. Token-only migration: clay→coral (`#C2541E`/`#A8330F`), borders `#E9E0D3`, surfaces `#F4EEE5`, headers → Spectral 32px. Zero icons/logos/logic changed.

## v1.21.0 — New look for Settings  (2026-06-25)
- All Settings screens got the new warm look — Members, Models, AI Settings, General, Integrations, Folder Sync, Audit, Identity Provider, SMTP, Feature Flags, and Analytics.
- A visual refresh only — every setting works exactly as before.
  - Migrated `layouts/settings.vue` + settings-imported components (`sync/FolderSyncPanel.vue`, Email/WhatsApp/Teams/Slack modals). Token-only: clay→coral (`#C2541E`/`#A8330F`), borders `#E9E0D3`, surfaces `#F4EEE5`, Spectral 32px headers.

## v1.20.0 — Simpler navigation + refreshed pages  (2026-06-25)
- Navigation is simpler: the old top dropdowns are replaced by a left side menu that shows just the section you're in.
- Open an agent and refresh — it now stays on the tab you were viewing instead of jumping back to the start.
- Templates, Knowledge, Instructions, Queries, Skills, Memory, Connectors, Evals, and Workflows all got the new warm look.
  - `components/nav/AppRail.vue` replaces top-nav dropdowns; nav model in shared `composables/useAppNav.ts` (TopNav + AppRail). Mounted in `layouts/default.vue` non-report branch; self-hides on pages that own a rail.
  - Studio detail `?tab=` query persists the sub-tab on refresh. Templates restyled to Workspace v2. Build/Manage warm migration + Spectral headers. (Monitoring console deferred.) Restyle only; data/logic/permissions unchanged.

## v1.19.0 — Studio detail retheme + Open/refresh crash fix (bake)  (2026-06-25)
- Rethemed the studio detail/workspace page (`pages/studios/[id]/index.vue`) to the warm design system: cream bg + Hanken body, coral accents (`#C2541E`/`#A8330F`), Spectral serif headings, warm borders (`#E9E0D3`).
- **Fixed studio Open → refresh crash** (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')`): teleported `FolderSyncSetupModal` + `FolderSyncCard` read `studio.name` in a separate reactive scope during the cold-load null window, before `fetchStudio` resolved — not covered by the parent `v-else-if` guard. Added `v-if="studio"` + `studio?.name || ''` on both.
- Bakes durable everything previously shipped via ephemeral FE-sync (studio retheme, crash fix, AgentThinking widget).
- Added `scripts/fe-sync.sh` — host `nuxt generate` + `docker cp` into `ca-app` for FE iteration without a full image rebuild (ephemeral; reverts on force-recreate).

## v1.18.0 — Design system rollout: Studios, Home, Nav, Reports + Agent status widget  (2026-06-25)
- Applied the Claude Design warm palette (cream `#F6F1EA`, ink `#1A1611`, coral `#C2541E`/`#A8330F`/`#D67037`, Spectral serif + Hanken Grotesk) across the authed app — restyle only, no functional changes.
- **Studios** (`pages/studios/index.vue` + `components/studio/StudioCard.vue`): cream bg, Spectral 38px header, "YOUR AGENT STUDIOS" label, coral New button. Card → Studios v2 mock: dark live-activity header (gradient + grid-drift + orange blob + animated equalizer on live / dashed "awaiting first source" on draft), white overlapping icon badge, Spectral italic persona, live-stats vs draft/ready progress, coral + ghost action bar. Equalizer + Live dot keep animating under reduced-motion.
- **Home** (`pages/index.vue`): cream bg, orange orb glow, greeting eyebrow, Spectral 46px "What should we *explore* today?", subtitle; dropped purple bottom-glow + full-logo hero. Real composer/suggestions/reports children unchanged.
- **Top nav** (`components/nav/TopNav.vue`): cream translucent bar (blur + `#E9E0D3` border), gradient logo mark + "City Agent Insights" wordmark, warm nav links (active `#A8330F`), cream New-report pill, dark-gradient avatar. Full-width — flush left/right, no side gap. Spectral + Hanken loaded app-wide here.
- **Reports** (`components/home/RecentReports.vue` + `RecentReportCard.vue`): scope dropdown → **segmented tab** (Main Org / My Reports). Cards restyled (badge + Chat/Dashboard buttons) keeping the **real** server thumbnail preview — no fake numbers; no-preview falls back to a mode icon.
- **Agent status widget** (`components/agent/AgentThinking.vue`, global in `layouts/default.vue`): floating coral robot launcher → dark terminal popover typing real boot lines (`synced N sources · M tables` from `/data_sources`, `vector index warm`, `ready.`) with blinking cursor; footer = Idle + real default model from `/llm/models`. Fail-soft, counts warmed in background.

## v1.17.0 — Login page redesign (Claude Design handoff)  (2026-06-25)
- Reimplemented `pages/users/sign-in.vue` pixel-faithful to the Claude Design mock (`City Agent Insights Login.dc.html`). New warm palette (`#F6F1EA` bg, `#C2541E`/`#A8330F` accent), Spectral serif headline + Hanken Grotesk body (loaded via `useHead`), gradient logo mark, floating-label EMAIL/PASSWORD fields with a Show/Hide pill.
- Removed the `4 sources · 11 tables · 67 columns · data 2026-06-20` stat line from the left column (per request).
- ALL auth buttons now present: Google + Microsoft (2-col social row) and a dedicated **Enterprise Sign-in** box with **SSO / Keycloak / LDAP**. Wiring: Google → `/api/auth/google/authorize`; Microsoft/Keycloak/SSO → `signInWithProvider()` matched against the org's configured OIDC providers (regex map, fail-soft message when a provider isn't configured); LDAP → reveals + focuses the directory username/password form (LDAP authenticates through the same `/api/auth/jwt/login`).
- Right panel replaced with an animated "agent at work" showcase: a 3-turn loop (pick data source → live progress checklist → result card with growing bar chart + delta), ported from the design's `DCLogic` state machine to Vue refs + timers, cleaned up on unmount, and disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Hidden below 1024px (single-column form on mobile).
- Version chip stays dynamic (`hybrid_version` from `/api/settings`).

## v1.16.1 — Login version chip is real (was hardcoded v2.4.0)  (2026-06-25)
- Sign-in page chip showed a stale hardcoded `v2.4.0 · local`. Now reads the real product version from `/api/settings.hybrid_version` (= VERSION_HYBRID) and derives the env label from the host (localhost → local, else prod).
- `/api/settings` (public, pre-auth) now returns `hybrid_version` via `changelog.current_version()` — distinct from the upstream-base `version` (PROJECT_VERSION).
- Dockerfile fix: `VERSION_HYBRID` + `CHANGELOG_HYBRID.md` are now COPY'd into the image at `/app/` (final stage). They were never copied, so `current_version()` always fell back to `0.0.0` — this also silently broke the in-app changelog popover. LANDMINE: `app/services/changelog.py` resolves `_REPO_ROOT=/app`; both files must live there in the image.

## v1.16.0 — Feature flags fully UI-owned; ENV is infra-only  (2026-06-25)
- ENV/compose stripped of all ~50 `HYBRID_*` flags + skill-exec knobs + compaction ratio. They now live exclusively in the UI (Settings → Features), persisted per-org in `organization_settings.config['hybrid_overrides']`.
- Defaults are now CODE-owned (`hybrid_flags.py`): 37 product-visible features default ON (Studios, Templates, Folder Sync, Intelligence + Knowledge layer, caches, autotrain, etc.), the rest OFF — so a fresh deploy is fully featured with zero env flags. Previously only `SCOPE_GATE` + `DASH_VERSIONS` defaulted ON and the nginx compose carried the real defaults.
- Resolution order unchanged: per-org override > env > code default. `load_overrides_from_db()` at boot (`main.py:431`) hydrates the process override store from DB — verified live ("Loaded 65 hybrid flag override(s)").
- One-shot migration froze each org's current effective env values into `hybrid_overrides` (org 55278108: 65 overrides, 51 ON) so removing env changed no live behaviour. Pre-existing UI overrides preserved (never clobbered).
- Lean `.env` (~15 vars): DB conn, `DASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, ports, `DASH_CONFIG_PATH`, `DASH_LICENSE_KEY`, `AUTOTRAIN_STAGING_*`, plus bootstrap seeds (LLM key/models via dash-config or UI; super-admin `DASH_ADMIN_*`).
- LANDMINE: do NOT re-add flag vars to compose/.env — they shadow the UI until an org sets an override. New flags get their default in `hybrid_flags.py` (`_bool("NAME", default)`), not in compose.

## v1.15.0 — Hybrid Search is real: embeddings via OpenRouter  (2026-06-25)
- `HYBRID_SEMANTIC_SEARCH` was a scaffold (empty index, no embedder, never wired). It now works end-to-end:
  - **Embedder** (`app/ai/knowledge/embeddings.py`) — reuses the org's existing OpenRouter key (OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings`), model `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim → matches the existing `embedding vector(1536)` column, no migration). Batched, fail-soft. Env knobs `HYBRID_EMBED_MODEL/DIM/BATCH`.
  - **Indexer** (`app/ai/knowledge/indexer.py`) — `reindex_org()` rebuilds `knowledge_search_index` from approved semantic tables / metrics / query library / docs, sets the PG `tsv` and the `embedding` vector.
  - **Retrieval** — `hybrid_search()` gained a pgvector cosine-KNN arm; now fuses FTS + vector + token-Jaccard via 3-way RRF.
  - **Wired into the agent** — new `HybridSearchContextBuilder` + section, primed in `context_hub` and appended to the planner instructions in `agent_v2` (gated by SEMANTIC_SEARCH). Top approved knowledge is injected as grounding for each question.
  - **UI + API** — `POST /api/knowledge/reindex` + `GET /api/knowledge/search-index/status`; a "Rebuild search index" button appears on the Hybrid Search row in Settings → Features when it's on.
- Proven live: 293 assets indexed + embedded via OpenRouter (200 OK); "revenue by month" returns Total Revenue / Revenue-by-Country etc. ranked by RRF.
- Flag reclassified `unstable` → `experimental` (works once a key is set). Without a key, only the full-text arm builds (still useful).

## v1.14.0 — All feature flags toggleable from the UI  (2026-06-25)
- Settings → Features now lists **every** hybrid flag (65, up from ~32), grouped into 8 sections (Core, Knowledge, Intelligence, Agents & Access, Ingest, Learning, Advanced, Daemons). Previously most flags — including Agent Studios itself, the caches, semantic/metrics layer, autotrain and the daemons — weren't registered, so they couldn't be toggled from the UI and the override was silently ignored.
- Each flag carries a status badge so risky ones are honest, not silently broken: `needs setup` (Forecast → needs Prophet bake; Federation → needs S3), `unstable` (Skills sandbox can livelock; Hybrid Search is a scaffold), `experimental` (Subagents/token-heavy, Bitemporal, etc.), `needs restart` (the boot-read daemons). Enabling an unstable/needs-setup flag pops a confirm dialog with the caveat.
- Page gained search + an Enabled/Disabled filter and an "N / M on" counter.
- Backend: extended `UPGRADE_FLAGS` with `category`/`status`/`note` per flag (and added every missing flag); `_effective()` now falls back to override-or-env for the env-only daemon knobs (no `flags` property). Same `GET/PUT /api/organization/hybrid-flags` endpoints — no new routes, no migration. Per-org overrides still beat `.env` and apply live (daemons after a restart).

## v1.13.2 — Fix "Sign-up is disabled" when admin creates a user  (2026-06-25)
- Direct user creation hit the fastapi-users registration gate (`_validate_user_creation`), which rejects any non-first signup when uninvited-signups are off → "Sign-up is disabled. Ask your admin for an invite." That gate is the invite flow the admin is explicitly opting out of. Admin-initiated creation now inserts the user directly (hash password + active/verified), bypassing the gate, then attaches the org membership. Mirrors the OAuth path's direct `user_db` create.

## v1.13.1 — Fix blank charts in dashboard full-screen  (2026-06-25)
- Clicking full-screen on a dashboard showed only the static header card with the rest black. The full-screen overlay renders a SECOND iframe, but the data was only ever posted to the background iframe — so the full-screen one rendered its chrome with empty charts. Now `ARTIFACT_DATA` is broadcast to both iframes (background + full-screen), plus a belt-and-suspenders re-send on the full-screen iframe's load. Charts now render in full-screen.

## v1.13.0 — Super-admin creates users directly + features ON in nginx deploy  (2026-06-25)
- Add user with email + password directly — NO email invitation. Settings → Members → "Add user" now takes a name, email and password and creates an active, verified account the user can sign in with immediately. New endpoint `POST /api/organizations/{id}/members/create-user` (admin-gated, `manage_members`); the password is set by the admin and shown in plain text in the form so it can be shared. The old email-invite path still exists for SMTP deployments.
- Fix "Agent Studios are not enabled" (and other locked pages) on the nginx deploy: `docker-compose.nginx.yaml` was missing the `HYBRID_*` env block entirely, so every feature flag fell back to its default-OFF. It now passes the full flag set with product-visible, stable features defaulting ON (Studios, Agent Templates, Folder Sync, per-agent ACL/Channels, follow-ups, semantic/metrics layer, deep profiler, proactive insights, golden queries, verified metrics, query/result/answer cache, domain packs, teach box, agent memory, auto-train, dual-schema/engineer assets, brain read/distiller). Daemons, experimental and token-heavy paths (Skills sandbox, Subagents, Skill Optimizer, Workflows, context compaction, federation, forecasting, all background daemons) stay OFF — enable per `.env`.
- `docker-compose.nginx.yaml` gains a Redis service (`dash-redis`) so the cache-backed features have a backing store; `REDIS_URL` defaults to `redis://redis:6379/0`.
- Apply on the server: `docker compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yaml up -d --build` (rebuilds the image with the new user-create UI/endpoint and recreates the app with flags on). To override any flag, set it in `.env` (e.g. `HYBRID_SUBAGENTS=1` or `HYBRID_STUDIOS=0`).

## v1.12.0 — nginx reverse-proxy stack  (2026-06-25)
- New `docker-compose.nginx.yaml` + `nginx/nginx.conf`: front the app with nginx (the default proxy for this deployment). nginx publishes the host port (`HTTP_PORT`, default 8001) and proxies to the app over the internal network; the app is not exposed directly.
- nginx tuned for this app: SSE streaming (`proxy_buffering off` so chat streams token-by-token), websocket upgrade passthrough, unlimited upload size, 1h read/send timeouts (no 504 on long agent runs).
- Run it: `docker compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yaml up -d --build` → `http://<host>:<HTTP_PORT>`. Set `HTTP_PORT` + `DASH_BASE_URL` in `.env`.
- Caddy stack (`docker-compose.yaml`, auto-HTTPS) and direct-port (`APP_PORT`) paths still available.

## v1.11.1 — Publish app on configurable host port  (2026-06-25)
- The main `docker-compose.yaml` (Caddy/SSL variant) now publishes the app on the host via `APP_PORT` (default 3000) instead of `expose:` only — fixes "app only shows 3000, can't reach my chosen port". Set `APP_PORT=8001` in `.env` to reach it at `http://<host>:8001`. The container always listens on 3000 internally; this maps host→3000.
- `.env.example` documents `APP_PORT` (and that `DASH_BASE_URL` should match it / your domain)
- Caddy front-door path unchanged: for HTTPS you can drop the published port and let Caddy proxy to `app:3000`

## v1.11.0 — One-command deploy + env super-admin  (2026-06-25)
- `docker compose up -d --build` now works on a clean machine with no pre-step — the runtime base image is folded into the main Dockerfile (no more "cityagent-base:dev pull access denied")
- New `deploy.sh`: one friendly command — bootstraps `.env` from the template, warns on a missing encryption key, then builds and starts everything
- Create the first owner/admin straight from env: set `DASH_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `DASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and a fresh deploy seeds the account automatically (idempotent — ignored once any user exists), no sign-up link or curl needed
- `.env.example` + `docker-compose.yaml` document the new admin vars; README/DEPLOY gained a one-command deploy section

## v1.10.0 — Per-agent access control + Telegram channels  (2026-06-25)
- Each agent (Studio) gets an "Access & Channels" settings tab
- Who-can-use: Master (whole org), Scoped (pick specific users/roles) or Link — enforced at chat time, not just in listings (flag HYBRID_AGENT_ACL)
- Per-agent model override: an agent can pin its own model (e.g. Opus) — precedence: request model > agent model > org default
- Per-agent Telegram channel: give an agent its own Telegram bot; only verified members can use it (or open to anyone), each bot is bound to exactly one agent (flag HYBRID_AGENT_CHANNELS)
- Reuses existing per-agent data connections + credential modes (shared vs per-user) so each agent stays data-isolated
- Both features default OFF — behaviour unchanged until enabled per org

## v1.9.0 — Default OpenRouter LLM + .env.example  (2026-06-25)
- New organizations are seeded with a ready OpenRouter provider and the current model set (Claude Sonnet 4.6 default, Claude Haiku 4.5 fast/small, plus Claude Opus 4.8, GPT-5.4 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash) — no manual provider setup
- The OpenRouter API key is left blank and entered from the UI (Settings → Models) — never stored in the repo or config; the seeded provider is editable (non-preset)
- Config-driven: `default_llm` block in dash-config supports `provider_type`, `additional_config` (base_url/verify_ssl) and `is_preset:false` for an editable, key-from-UI provider
- A blank key encrypts to a valid blob, so the model is listed and fails with a clear 401 until a real key is set — no decrypt crash
- Added a root `.env.example` documenting every environment variable (DB, encryption key, SSO, SMTP, license, ops) with placeholders only

## v1.8.0 — Rebrand to City Agent Insights  (2026-06-25)
- New CityAgent Insights logo across the app — top nav, home page and the sign-in page
- Renamed "City Agent DASH" → "City Agent Insights" everywhere (default analyst name too)
- Sign-in page cleaned up: removed the sign-up link
- LDAP is now enabled by default in org settings

## v1.7.0 — Slide workspace: Open a deck to edit & analyze  (2026-06-25)
- "Open" on a presentation now opens a clean slide workspace — the deck big on the left, a chat on the right
- The right chat is framed for slides ("Edit & analyze slides") — ask it to edit a slide or analyze the deck
- The cluttered panel tabs are hidden in this mode — just the deck
- Expand a slide to true fullscreen (Esc to exit); slide navigation stays usable
- Empty decks show a clear "No slides yet — generate a deck" instead of a blank panel
- Clearer list buttons: Open (slide workspace) vs Open in chat (the conversation); 0-slide decks say "Open & generate"

## v1.6.0 — Upload a whole folder at once  (2026-06-25)
- New "Upload a whole folder" button in the file-upload modal — picks every Excel/CSV inside a folder in one go
- Each spreadsheet becomes its own data agent (Office lock files and non-spreadsheets are skipped)
- One-shot from the browser — no desktop app needed (for continuous auto-sync, use Folder Sync ⟳)

## v1.5.1 — Folder Sync: working download buttons  (2026-06-25)
- The macOS / Windows / Linux buttons now actually download the sync app (a small Python program) as a zip
- Each download includes an INSTALL.txt with the exact setup commands for that OS
- (Signed native installers still to come — for now: pip install + python sync_agent.py)

## v1.5.0 — Folder Sync: a local folder, like Claude Code  (2026-06-25)
- Desktop sync app: point it at a folder and new/changed Excel & CSV files become data agents automatically — no clicks
- Per-agent binding: a folder syncs into a specific agent; the tray app picks which one
- Smart deltas: byte-identical files are skipped, edited files replace the same agent (no duplicates), deletes are ignored
- API-key auth: the headless agent pairs with a one-time sync key — generate it from Settings → Folder Sync or any agent's "Add data → Sync a folder"
- Connected-machines view: see every machine, its folder→agent mappings, file counts and last sync time
- Off by default (HYBRID_FOLDER_SYNC) — turn it on per org

## v1.4.2 — Clearer Agent Studios page  (2026-06-25)
- One "New Agent Studio" button (removed the duplicate add card)
- Lifecycle status on every card: Draft → Ready → Live → Idle
- Agents with no data now clearly say "needs data" with an Add-data button
- Cleaner cards — real stats only once they exist, no rows of zeros

## v1.4.1 — Smoother "Use template" journey  (2026-06-25)
- Use template now opens a guided popup (preview → data → map → review → build) instead of a page jump
- Three ways to add data: use an existing source, connect/upload new, or skip and add it later
- Skip builds the agent with the playbook now; bind columns when your data arrives

## v1.4.0 — Agent Templates: share an agent's best practices  (2026-06-25)
- Export a smart agent as a portable, versioned Template — rules, metric formulas, example patterns, skills and persona, with data and credentials stripped
- Template Gallery: browse Org and Global templates and reuse them
- Bind wizard: map a template's required columns to your own data, then build your own agent
- Imported rules and metrics land pending for review — never auto-applied

## v1.3.0 — Install as an app  (2026-06-25)
- Installable PWA: add CityAgent to your desktop or home screen as a standalone app
- One-click "Install app" button in the top bar (next to notifications)
- Offline app shell — the interface loads even on a flaky connection
- Auto-update: the app refreshes to the latest version on its own

## v1.2.0 — Intelligence Layer — 8 agent grounding capabilities  (2026-06-25)
- Deep Profiler: per-column role catalog (dimension / measure / identifier / temporal) plus value distribution and variant warnings
- Verified Metrics: locked, authoritative metric values that override improvised formulas
- Golden Queries: proven SQL is promoted and reused first
- Proactive Insights: anomaly and trend chips surfaced on every result
- Lazy Profile: tables added after training are profiled inline at query time
- Studio Intelligence rail: a new per-agent panel to view and toggle all eight capabilities
- "What's new" notifications: a release feed in the top bar with a version chip

## v1.1.0 — Studios, Auto-train pipeline & Domain Packs  (2026-06-23)
- Agent Studios: wrap pinned data sources into a grounded, shareable analytics agent
- Auto-train everything: one button to profile columns, mine joins, write example queries and generate artifacts
- Domain Packs: 48 lightweight skill recipes that steer the planner without executing code
- Teach Box: paste an analysis and have it classified into a skill, instruction, data rule or knowledge
- Auto-pilot studio home: add a source or upload files, then train in three steps
- BI dashboards: cross-filtering, conditional formatting, KPI cards and data bars

## v1.0.0 — Hybrid brain foundation  (2026-06-18)
- OpenRouter-only LLM wiring (per-org Fernet-encrypted key)
- Knowledge Layer: semantic model, metrics catalog and query library with an approval gate
- 2nd-brain learning: self-distillation from feedback, query cache and a serving funnel
- Self-service Skills with progressive disclosure and promote-from-chat authoring
- Answer cache and verified-metric grounding for faster, more reliable answers
