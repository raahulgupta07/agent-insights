# What's new — CityAgent Analytics

Hybrid feature changelog (our additions on top of the bagofwords/Dash base). Newest first.
Format per entry: `## v<semver> — <title>  (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` then bullets.
Bullet rules (this is the user-facing "What's new" feed):
  - **Top-level** `- ` bullets are USER-FACING — plain language, no file paths / jargon / markdown.
    These show in the in-app "What's new" popover.
  - **Indented** `  - ` bullets are TECHNICAL detail — file paths, flags, internals.
    Hidden from the popover; shown collapsed on the full /changelog page only.
Every shipped feature bumps `VERSION_HYBRID` and adds an entry here.

## v1.27.0 — Tidier card buttons on Decks and Dashboards  (2026-06-26)
- The Open / Chat buttons on deck cards no longer wrap onto two lines — they sit flat and are the same size.
- The Chat / Dashboard buttons on dashboard cards are now exactly the same width.
  - Presentations cards (`pages/presentations/index.vue`): shortened labels (Open & generate → Generate, Open in chat → Chat), added `whitespace-nowrap` + `box-border` + `min-w-0` so the two-column grid buttons stay single-line and equal.
  - `components/home/RecentReportCard.vue` (Dashboards + Home grids): button CSS `flex: 1 1 0; width: 0; box-sizing: border-box; white-space: nowrap` so the bordered ghost and borderless primary render identical width.

## v1.26.0 — Channels: use the org default or a custom connection  (2026-06-26)
- For every channel (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, AI Mailbox, Telegram, MCP) you can now choose: use the organization's shared connection, or set up a custom one just for this agent — same choice you already have for Email.
- Channels default to the organization's connection, so an agent works out of the box with nothing to configure. Switch to "Custom for this agent" only when you want its own app, bot, or number.
- Removed the confusing "locked" message — replaced with a clear note that, whichever connection you pick, every channel still answers only from this agent's data.
  - `components/studio/StudioChannels.vue`: per-platform mode radio (global vs custom). Mode derived from data — a per-studio channel row = custom, none = org default; local override lets the user flip to custom before a row exists. Global branch shows an org-default note + "Remove custom" revert; custom branch keeps Set up/Reconfigure/Enable/Disable/Delete. Status chip is mode-aware (Org default / Connected / Not connected). No backend change — relies on existing NULL studio_id → org fallback.
- The "What's new" notes are now written in plain language instead of developer shorthand, so anyone can understand what changed.
- Curious about the deep technical details of a release? They're tucked under a "Technical details" toggle on the full What's new page.
  - Changelog parser (`backend/app/services/changelog.py`) splits bullets: top-level `- ` → `features` (user-facing, shown in popover), indented `  - ` → `details` (technical, hidden from popover).
  - Full page `pages/changelog/index.vue` renders `details` under a collapsed `<details>` toggle. Popover `WhatsNew.vue` unchanged (already renders `features` only). Recent entries (v1.20–1.24) rewritten plain + technical detail moved to indented bullets.

## v1.24.0 — Connect each agent to its own channels and email  (2026-06-26)
- Each agent now has its own Channels tab. Connect Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, an AI Mailbox, Telegram, or MCP to a single agent — pick a platform on the left, set it up on the right. Turn any channel on or off without touching your other agents.
- Each agent now has its own Email / SMTP tab. An agent can send its emails (shared results, scheduled reports, replies) using the company default, or you can give it its own mail server. A one-click "send test" confirms it works before you rely on it.
- The agent's left menu is now split into Access & Members, Channels, and Email / SMTP, so settings are easier to find.
- App updates ship faster — rebuilds are quicker behind the scenes.
  - Channels UI: `components/studio/StudioChannels.vue` — org-style two-pane picker (platform list + detail pane), reuses the Slack/Teams/WhatsApp/AI-Mailbox modals + Telegram/MCP. Per-platform status dot + set-up/reconfigure/enable/disable/delete, scoped to the studio.
  - Email UI: `components/studio/StudioEmail.vue` — mode radio (global default vs custom), custom fields mirror org SMTP (host/port/security/user/pass/from/validate-certs) + test. Stored in `Studio.config['smtp']` (Fernet password), no migration.
  - Backend: `email_client_resolver` per-agent SMTP tier (`get_studio_smtp` + `studio_smtp` precedence in `choose_outbound`; `resolve_outbound(..., studio_id=)`) wins over org/global. Routes `GET/PUT/POST-test /api/studios/{id}/smtp` (flag `HYBRID_AGENT_CHANNELS`, owner/editor). `studio_id` threaded through `notification_service`, `report.py` share, `email_send_service` replies. NULL studio / global mode = unchanged.
  - Dockerfile: dropped non-deterministic `apt-get upgrade -y` from builder stages (cache-stable); BuildKit cache mounts for Vite/Nuxt transform caches on `yarn generate`. Runtime `base` stage keeps its security upgrade.

## v1.23.0 — Faster dashboards on big results + agents answer in chat apps  (2026-06-26)
- Big result tables now load faster and take up far less storage, so dashboards built on large queries open quicker.
- Filter, sort, and page through large results live — only the rows you're looking at are fetched, even on millions of rows.
- Agents can now answer in Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, an AI Mailbox, Telegram, or MCP. A question coming from a channel is automatically answered using only that agent's data.
  - Parquet result storage: `backend/app/services/parquet_store.py` — results ≥`HYBRID_PARQUET_MIN_ROWS`=2000 rows offload to compressed Parquet on the `ca_uploads` volume instead of inline JSON in Postgres. Transparent hydrate on read; flag `HYBRID_PARQUET_RESULTS` default ON; crash-safe, fail-soft, daily purge GC. Docs: `docs/parquet-results.md`.
  - Interactive query endpoint `POST /steps/{id}/query`: allow-listed DuckDB pushdown (filter/group/agg/sort/page), returns slice + true total_rows, no raw SQL, limit cap 5000. Frontend `useStepQuery` + dashboard routes for `source:"parquet"` steps; inline steps keep client-side path.
  - Per-agent channels (flag `HYBRID_AGENT_CHANNELS` default ON): per-studio CRUD for all types (upsert, Fernet creds, audience). Inbound webhooks bind the report to the matched channel's `studio_id` → ReportService auto-scopes to that studio's sources. NULL studio_id = unchanged.
  - `scripts/safe-upgrade.sh` (NEW): guarded bake — rollback-tag image, backup DB+uploads together, health-gate, auto-rollback on failure.

## v1.22.0 — New look, now everywhere  (2026-06-26)
- The new warm look is now applied across the whole app — reports, chat, agents, monitoring, evals, templates, onboarding, sign-in, files, and shared/embedded pages all match.
- A visual refresh only — nothing about how the app works changed.
  - Completed the warm-palette rollout: 32 remaining pages + 148 components + 3 layouts. Token-only migration: clay→coral (`#C2541E`/`#A8330F`), borders `#E9E0D3`, surfaces `#F4EEE5`, headers → Spectral 32px. Zero icons/logos/logic changed.

## v1.21.0 — New look for Settings  (2026-06-25)
- All Settings screens got the new warm look — Members, Models, AI Settings, General, Integrations, Folder Sync, Audit, Identity Provider, SMTP, Feature Flags, and Analytics.
- A visual refresh only — every setting works exactly as before.
  - Migrated `layouts/settings.vue` + settings-imported components (`sync/FolderSyncPanel.vue`, Email/WhatsApp/Teams/Slack modals). Token-only: clay→coral (`#C2541E`/`#A8330F`), borders `#E9E0D3`, surfaces `#F4EEE5`, Spectral 32px headers.

## v1.20.0 — Simpler navigation + refreshed pages  (2026-06-25)
- Navigation is simpler: the old top dropdowns are replaced by a left side menu that shows just the section you're in.
- Open an agent and refresh — it now stays on the tab you were viewing instead of jumping back to the start.
- Templates, Knowledge, Instructions, Queries, Skills, Memory, Connectors, Evals, and Workflows all got the new warm look.
  - `components/nav/AppRail.vue` replaces top-nav dropdowns; nav model in shared `composables/useAppNav.ts` (TopNav + AppRail). Mounted in `layouts/default.vue` non-report branch; self-hides on pages that own a rail.
  - Studio detail `?tab=` query persists the sub-tab on refresh. Templates restyled to Workspace v2. Build/Manage warm migration + Spectral headers. (Monitoring console deferred.) Restyle only; data/logic/permissions unchanged.

## v1.19.0 — Studio detail retheme + Open/refresh crash fix (bake)  (2026-06-25)
- Rethemed the studio detail/workspace page (`pages/studios/[id]/index.vue`) to the warm design system: cream bg + Hanken body, coral accents (`#C2541E`/`#A8330F`), Spectral serif headings, warm borders (`#E9E0D3`).
- **Fixed studio Open → refresh crash** (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')`): teleported `FolderSyncSetupModal` + `FolderSyncCard` read `studio.name` in a separate reactive scope during the cold-load null window, before `fetchStudio` resolved — not covered by the parent `v-else-if` guard. Added `v-if="studio"` + `studio?.name || ''` on both.
- Bakes durable everything previously shipped via ephemeral FE-sync (studio retheme, crash fix, AgentThinking widget).
- Added `scripts/fe-sync.sh` — host `nuxt generate` + `docker cp` into `ca-app` for FE iteration without a full image rebuild (ephemeral; reverts on force-recreate).

## v1.18.0 — Design system rollout: Studios, Home, Nav, Reports + Agent status widget  (2026-06-25)
- Applied the Claude Design warm palette (cream `#F6F1EA`, ink `#1A1611`, coral `#C2541E`/`#A8330F`/`#D67037`, Spectral serif + Hanken Grotesk) across the authed app — restyle only, no functional changes.
- **Studios** (`pages/studios/index.vue` + `components/studio/StudioCard.vue`): cream bg, Spectral 38px header, "YOUR AGENT STUDIOS" label, coral New button. Card → Studios v2 mock: dark live-activity header (gradient + grid-drift + orange blob + animated equalizer on live / dashed "awaiting first source" on draft), white overlapping icon badge, Spectral italic persona, live-stats vs draft/ready progress, coral + ghost action bar. Equalizer + Live dot keep animating under reduced-motion.
- **Home** (`pages/index.vue`): cream bg, orange orb glow, greeting eyebrow, Spectral 46px "What should we *explore* today?", subtitle; dropped purple bottom-glow + full-logo hero. Real composer/suggestions/reports children unchanged.
- **Top nav** (`components/nav/TopNav.vue`): cream translucent bar (blur + `#E9E0D3` border), gradient logo mark + "City Agent Insights" wordmark, warm nav links (active `#A8330F`), cream New-report pill, dark-gradient avatar. Full-width — flush left/right, no side gap. Spectral + Hanken loaded app-wide here.
- **Reports** (`components/home/RecentReports.vue` + `RecentReportCard.vue`): scope dropdown → **segmented tab** (Main Org / My Reports). Cards restyled (badge + Chat/Dashboard buttons) keeping the **real** server thumbnail preview — no fake numbers; no-preview falls back to a mode icon.
- **Agent status widget** (`components/agent/AgentThinking.vue`, global in `layouts/default.vue`): floating coral robot launcher → dark terminal popover typing real boot lines (`synced N sources · M tables` from `/data_sources`, `vector index warm`, `ready.`) with blinking cursor; footer = Idle + real default model from `/llm/models`. Fail-soft, counts warmed in background.

## v1.17.0 — Login page redesign (Claude Design handoff)  (2026-06-25)
- Reimplemented `pages/users/sign-in.vue` pixel-faithful to the Claude Design mock (`City Agent Insights Login.dc.html`). New warm palette (`#F6F1EA` bg, `#C2541E`/`#A8330F` accent), Spectral serif headline + Hanken Grotesk body (loaded via `useHead`), gradient logo mark, floating-label EMAIL/PASSWORD fields with a Show/Hide pill.
- Removed the `4 sources · 11 tables · 67 columns · data 2026-06-20` stat line from the left column (per request).
- ALL auth buttons now present: Google + Microsoft (2-col social row) and a dedicated **Enterprise Sign-in** box with **SSO / Keycloak / LDAP**. Wiring: Google → `/api/auth/google/authorize`; Microsoft/Keycloak/SSO → `signInWithProvider()` matched against the org's configured OIDC providers (regex map, fail-soft message when a provider isn't configured); LDAP → reveals + focuses the directory username/password form (LDAP authenticates through the same `/api/auth/jwt/login`).
- Right panel replaced with an animated "agent at work" showcase: a 3-turn loop (pick data source → live progress checklist → result card with growing bar chart + delta), ported from the design's `DCLogic` state machine to Vue refs + timers, cleaned up on unmount, and disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Hidden below 1024px (single-column form on mobile).
- Version chip stays dynamic (`hybrid_version` from `/api/settings`).

## v1.16.1 — Login version chip is real (was hardcoded v2.4.0)  (2026-06-25)
- Sign-in page chip showed a stale hardcoded `v2.4.0 · local`. Now reads the real product version from `/api/settings.hybrid_version` (= VERSION_HYBRID) and derives the env label from the host (localhost → local, else prod).
- `/api/settings` (public, pre-auth) now returns `hybrid_version` via `changelog.current_version()` — distinct from the upstream-base `version` (PROJECT_VERSION).
- Dockerfile fix: `VERSION_HYBRID` + `CHANGELOG_HYBRID.md` are now COPY'd into the image at `/app/` (final stage). They were never copied, so `current_version()` always fell back to `0.0.0` — this also silently broke the in-app changelog popover. LANDMINE: `app/services/changelog.py` resolves `_REPO_ROOT=/app`; both files must live there in the image.

## v1.16.0 — Feature flags fully UI-owned; ENV is infra-only  (2026-06-25)
- ENV/compose stripped of all ~50 `HYBRID_*` flags + skill-exec knobs + compaction ratio. They now live exclusively in the UI (Settings → Features), persisted per-org in `organization_settings.config['hybrid_overrides']`.
- Defaults are now CODE-owned (`hybrid_flags.py`): 37 product-visible features default ON (Studios, Templates, Folder Sync, Intelligence + Knowledge layer, caches, autotrain, etc.), the rest OFF — so a fresh deploy is fully featured with zero env flags. Previously only `SCOPE_GATE` + `DASH_VERSIONS` defaulted ON and the nginx compose carried the real defaults.
- Resolution order unchanged: per-org override > env > code default. `load_overrides_from_db()` at boot (`main.py:431`) hydrates the process override store from DB — verified live ("Loaded 65 hybrid flag override(s)").
- One-shot migration froze each org's current effective env values into `hybrid_overrides` (org 55278108: 65 overrides, 51 ON) so removing env changed no live behaviour. Pre-existing UI overrides preserved (never clobbered).
- Lean `.env` (~15 vars): DB conn, `DASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, ports, `DASH_CONFIG_PATH`, `DASH_LICENSE_KEY`, `AUTOTRAIN_STAGING_*`, plus bootstrap seeds (LLM key/models via dash-config or UI; super-admin `DASH_ADMIN_*`).
- LANDMINE: do NOT re-add flag vars to compose/.env — they shadow the UI until an org sets an override. New flags get their default in `hybrid_flags.py` (`_bool("NAME", default)`), not in compose.

## v1.15.0 — Hybrid Search is real: embeddings via OpenRouter  (2026-06-25)
- `HYBRID_SEMANTIC_SEARCH` was a scaffold (empty index, no embedder, never wired). It now works end-to-end:
  - **Embedder** (`app/ai/knowledge/embeddings.py`) — reuses the org's existing OpenRouter key (OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings`), model `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim → matches the existing `embedding vector(1536)` column, no migration). Batched, fail-soft. Env knobs `HYBRID_EMBED_MODEL/DIM/BATCH`.
  - **Indexer** (`app/ai/knowledge/indexer.py`) — `reindex_org()` rebuilds `knowledge_search_index` from approved semantic tables / metrics / query library / docs, sets the PG `tsv` and the `embedding` vector.
  - **Retrieval** — `hybrid_search()` gained a pgvector cosine-KNN arm; now fuses FTS + vector + token-Jaccard via 3-way RRF.
  - **Wired into the agent** — new `HybridSearchContextBuilder` + section, primed in `context_hub` and appended to the planner instructions in `agent_v2` (gated by SEMANTIC_SEARCH). Top approved knowledge is injected as grounding for each question.
  - **UI + API** — `POST /api/knowledge/reindex` + `GET /api/knowledge/search-index/status`; a "Rebuild search index" button appears on the Hybrid Search row in Settings → Features when it's on.
- Proven live: 293 assets indexed + embedded via OpenRouter (200 OK); "revenue by month" returns Total Revenue / Revenue-by-Country etc. ranked by RRF.
- Flag reclassified `unstable` → `experimental` (works once a key is set). Without a key, only the full-text arm builds (still useful).

## v1.14.0 — All feature flags toggleable from the UI  (2026-06-25)
- Settings → Features now lists **every** hybrid flag (65, up from ~32), grouped into 8 sections (Core, Knowledge, Intelligence, Agents & Access, Ingest, Learning, Advanced, Daemons). Previously most flags — including Agent Studios itself, the caches, semantic/metrics layer, autotrain and the daemons — weren't registered, so they couldn't be toggled from the UI and the override was silently ignored.
- Each flag carries a status badge so risky ones are honest, not silently broken: `needs setup` (Forecast → needs Prophet bake; Federation → needs S3), `unstable` (Skills sandbox can livelock; Hybrid Search is a scaffold), `experimental` (Subagents/token-heavy, Bitemporal, etc.), `needs restart` (the boot-read daemons). Enabling an unstable/needs-setup flag pops a confirm dialog with the caveat.
- Page gained search + an Enabled/Disabled filter and an "N / M on" counter.
- Backend: extended `UPGRADE_FLAGS` with `category`/`status`/`note` per flag (and added every missing flag); `_effective()` now falls back to override-or-env for the env-only daemon knobs (no `flags` property). Same `GET/PUT /api/organization/hybrid-flags` endpoints — no new routes, no migration. Per-org overrides still beat `.env` and apply live (daemons after a restart).

## v1.13.2 — Fix "Sign-up is disabled" when admin creates a user  (2026-06-25)
- Direct user creation hit the fastapi-users registration gate (`_validate_user_creation`), which rejects any non-first signup when uninvited-signups are off → "Sign-up is disabled. Ask your admin for an invite." That gate is the invite flow the admin is explicitly opting out of. Admin-initiated creation now inserts the user directly (hash password + active/verified), bypassing the gate, then attaches the org membership. Mirrors the OAuth path's direct `user_db` create.

## v1.13.1 — Fix blank charts in dashboard full-screen  (2026-06-25)
- Clicking full-screen on a dashboard showed only the static header card with the rest black. The full-screen overlay renders a SECOND iframe, but the data was only ever posted to the background iframe — so the full-screen one rendered its chrome with empty charts. Now `ARTIFACT_DATA` is broadcast to both iframes (background + full-screen), plus a belt-and-suspenders re-send on the full-screen iframe's load. Charts now render in full-screen.

## v1.13.0 — Super-admin creates users directly + features ON in nginx deploy  (2026-06-25)
- Add user with email + password directly — NO email invitation. Settings → Members → "Add user" now takes a name, email and password and creates an active, verified account the user can sign in with immediately. New endpoint `POST /api/organizations/{id}/members/create-user` (admin-gated, `manage_members`); the password is set by the admin and shown in plain text in the form so it can be shared. The old email-invite path still exists for SMTP deployments.
- Fix "Agent Studios are not enabled" (and other locked pages) on the nginx deploy: `docker-compose.nginx.yaml` was missing the `HYBRID_*` env block entirely, so every feature flag fell back to its default-OFF. It now passes the full flag set with product-visible, stable features defaulting ON (Studios, Agent Templates, Folder Sync, per-agent ACL/Channels, follow-ups, semantic/metrics layer, deep profiler, proactive insights, golden queries, verified metrics, query/result/answer cache, domain packs, teach box, agent memory, auto-train, dual-schema/engineer assets, brain read/distiller). Daemons, experimental and token-heavy paths (Skills sandbox, Subagents, Skill Optimizer, Workflows, context compaction, federation, forecasting, all background daemons) stay OFF — enable per `.env`.
- `docker-compose.nginx.yaml` gains a Redis service (`dash-redis`) so the cache-backed features have a backing store; `REDIS_URL` defaults to `redis://redis:6379/0`.
- Apply on the server: `docker compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yaml up -d --build` (rebuilds the image with the new user-create UI/endpoint and recreates the app with flags on). To override any flag, set it in `.env` (e.g. `HYBRID_SUBAGENTS=1` or `HYBRID_STUDIOS=0`).

## v1.12.0 — nginx reverse-proxy stack  (2026-06-25)
- New `docker-compose.nginx.yaml` + `nginx/nginx.conf`: front the app with nginx (the default proxy for this deployment). nginx publishes the host port (`HTTP_PORT`, default 8001) and proxies to the app over the internal network; the app is not exposed directly.
- nginx tuned for this app: SSE streaming (`proxy_buffering off` so chat streams token-by-token), websocket upgrade passthrough, unlimited upload size, 1h read/send timeouts (no 504 on long agent runs).
- Run it: `docker compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yaml up -d --build` → `http://<host>:<HTTP_PORT>`. Set `HTTP_PORT` + `DASH_BASE_URL` in `.env`.
- Caddy stack (`docker-compose.yaml`, auto-HTTPS) and direct-port (`APP_PORT`) paths still available.

## v1.11.1 — Publish app on configurable host port  (2026-06-25)
- The main `docker-compose.yaml` (Caddy/SSL variant) now publishes the app on the host via `APP_PORT` (default 3000) instead of `expose:` only — fixes "app only shows 3000, can't reach my chosen port". Set `APP_PORT=8001` in `.env` to reach it at `http://<host>:8001`. The container always listens on 3000 internally; this maps host→3000.
- `.env.example` documents `APP_PORT` (and that `DASH_BASE_URL` should match it / your domain)
- Caddy front-door path unchanged: for HTTPS you can drop the published port and let Caddy proxy to `app:3000`

## v1.11.0 — One-command deploy + env super-admin  (2026-06-25)
- `docker compose up -d --build` now works on a clean machine with no pre-step — the runtime base image is folded into the main Dockerfile (no more "cityagent-base:dev pull access denied")
- New `deploy.sh`: one friendly command — bootstraps `.env` from the template, warns on a missing encryption key, then builds and starts everything
- Create the first owner/admin straight from env: set `DASH_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `DASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and a fresh deploy seeds the account automatically (idempotent — ignored once any user exists), no sign-up link or curl needed
- `.env.example` + `docker-compose.yaml` document the new admin vars; README/DEPLOY gained a one-command deploy section

## v1.10.0 — Per-agent access control + Telegram channels  (2026-06-25)
- Each agent (Studio) gets an "Access & Channels" settings tab
- Who-can-use: Master (whole org), Scoped (pick specific users/roles) or Link — enforced at chat time, not just in listings (flag HYBRID_AGENT_ACL)
- Per-agent model override: an agent can pin its own model (e.g. Opus) — precedence: request model > agent model > org default
- Per-agent Telegram channel: give an agent its own Telegram bot; only verified members can use it (or open to anyone), each bot is bound to exactly one agent (flag HYBRID_AGENT_CHANNELS)
- Reuses existing per-agent data connections + credential modes (shared vs per-user) so each agent stays data-isolated
- Both features default OFF — behaviour unchanged until enabled per org

## v1.9.0 — Default OpenRouter LLM + .env.example  (2026-06-25)
- New organizations are seeded with a ready OpenRouter provider and the current model set (Claude Sonnet 4.6 default, Claude Haiku 4.5 fast/small, plus Claude Opus 4.8, GPT-5.4 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash) — no manual provider setup
- The OpenRouter API key is left blank and entered from the UI (Settings → Models) — never stored in the repo or config; the seeded provider is editable (non-preset)
- Config-driven: `default_llm` block in dash-config supports `provider_type`, `additional_config` (base_url/verify_ssl) and `is_preset:false` for an editable, key-from-UI provider
- A blank key encrypts to a valid blob, so the model is listed and fails with a clear 401 until a real key is set — no decrypt crash
- Added a root `.env.example` documenting every environment variable (DB, encryption key, SSO, SMTP, license, ops) with placeholders only

## v1.8.0 — Rebrand to City Agent Insights  (2026-06-25)
- New CityAgent Insights logo across the app — top nav, home page and the sign-in page
- Renamed "City Agent DASH" → "City Agent Insights" everywhere (default analyst name too)
- Sign-in page cleaned up: removed the sign-up link
- LDAP is now enabled by default in org settings

## v1.7.0 — Slide workspace: Open a deck to edit & analyze  (2026-06-25)
- "Open" on a presentation now opens a clean slide workspace — the deck big on the left, a chat on the right
- The right chat is framed for slides ("Edit & analyze slides") — ask it to edit a slide or analyze the deck
- The cluttered panel tabs are hidden in this mode — just the deck
- Expand a slide to true fullscreen (Esc to exit); slide navigation stays usable
- Empty decks show a clear "No slides yet — generate a deck" instead of a blank panel
- Clearer list buttons: Open (slide workspace) vs Open in chat (the conversation); 0-slide decks say "Open & generate"

## v1.6.0 — Upload a whole folder at once  (2026-06-25)
- New "Upload a whole folder" button in the file-upload modal — picks every Excel/CSV inside a folder in one go
- Each spreadsheet becomes its own data agent (Office lock files and non-spreadsheets are skipped)
- One-shot from the browser — no desktop app needed (for continuous auto-sync, use Folder Sync ⟳)

## v1.5.1 — Folder Sync: working download buttons  (2026-06-25)
- The macOS / Windows / Linux buttons now actually download the sync app (a small Python program) as a zip
- Each download includes an INSTALL.txt with the exact setup commands for that OS
- (Signed native installers still to come — for now: pip install + python sync_agent.py)

## v1.5.0 — Folder Sync: a local folder, like Claude Code  (2026-06-25)
- Desktop sync app: point it at a folder and new/changed Excel & CSV files become data agents automatically — no clicks
- Per-agent binding: a folder syncs into a specific agent; the tray app picks which one
- Smart deltas: byte-identical files are skipped, edited files replace the same agent (no duplicates), deletes are ignored
- API-key auth: the headless agent pairs with a one-time sync key — generate it from Settings → Folder Sync or any agent's "Add data → Sync a folder"
- Connected-machines view: see every machine, its folder→agent mappings, file counts and last sync time
- Off by default (HYBRID_FOLDER_SYNC) — turn it on per org

## v1.4.2 — Clearer Agent Studios page  (2026-06-25)
- One "New Agent Studio" button (removed the duplicate add card)
- Lifecycle status on every card: Draft → Ready → Live → Idle
- Agents with no data now clearly say "needs data" with an Add-data button
- Cleaner cards — real stats only once they exist, no rows of zeros

## v1.4.1 — Smoother "Use template" journey  (2026-06-25)
- Use template now opens a guided popup (preview → data → map → review → build) instead of a page jump
- Three ways to add data: use an existing source, connect/upload new, or skip and add it later
- Skip builds the agent with the playbook now; bind columns when your data arrives

## v1.4.0 — Agent Templates: share an agent's best practices  (2026-06-25)
- Export a smart agent as a portable, versioned Template — rules, metric formulas, example patterns, skills and persona, with data and credentials stripped
- Template Gallery: browse Org and Global templates and reuse them
- Bind wizard: map a template's required columns to your own data, then build your own agent
- Imported rules and metrics land pending for review — never auto-applied

## v1.3.0 — Install as an app  (2026-06-25)
- Installable PWA: add CityAgent to your desktop or home screen as a standalone app
- One-click "Install app" button in the top bar (next to notifications)
