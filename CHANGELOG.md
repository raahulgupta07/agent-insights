# Release Notes

## Version 0.0.412 (June 16, 2026)
- **Apache Druid data source** — connect to Apache Druid and query it as a new data source.
- **Trino data source** — connect to the Trino distributed SQL engine and query it as a new data source.

## Version 0.0.411 (June 15, 2026)
- **⌘K command palette** — a global **⌘K / Ctrl+K** palette for quick navigation and creation, opened from anywhere in the app. One input searches across **recent reports**, **agents**, and **instructions** (server-side search for reports/instructions, client-side filtering for agents; recents shown by default), with pinned, query-echoing create actions: `New report "…"` (creates and navigates) and a permission-aware `New instruction "…"` / `Suggest instruction "…"` that opens the instruction modal pre-filled with the typed text. No-match queries still surface the create actions.
- **Publishing lifecycle for agents (`publish_status`)** — a manager-set publishing state, distinct from the system-managed connection-health flag: **published** (visible to everyone with access), **draft** (visible only to builders who can `manage` the agent), and **disabled** (hidden everywhere and excluded from AI context). Viewer-aware filtering applies across the data-source/agent selector, schema context, and public (Slack) listing; consumers see only published agents while managers also see drafts. Existing agents are backfilled to *published*.
- **Agent research tools (`search_reports` / `read_report`)** — two read-only planner tools that let the agent discover and read **the current user's own reports**: `search_reports` lists/substring-searches the caller's reports by title with status/mode filters, and `read_report` returns one of the caller's reports (metadata, data sources, artifact summary, conversation). Both are strictly scoped to the caller — any other report, including ones merely shared with the user, returns *not found* (no leak) — and each has its own tool card in the report view.
- **Settings → Channels** — the settings **Integrations** tab is renamed **Channels** across all locales, with a redesigned page (and a new empty state). The **SMTP Server** configuration moves from a modal into its own dedicated settings page.
- **Test Connection for existing LLM providers** — the **Test Connection** button is now available when editing an existing LLM provider, not just when adding a new one. Blank credential fields fall back to the stored (encrypted) values, so you can re-test a saved provider without re-entering secrets.
- **Instruction modal redesign** — the create/edit instruction modal gains a wider split layout with a dedicated, slide-in **analysis panel** (related instructions, impacted prompts, and impact score) and a cleaner global-vs-private form structure.
- **Scheduled tasks** — clicking a scheduled task card now opens its edit modal directly (clicking the report name still navigates to the report), and the modal shows a link back to the report when editing a task tied to one.
- **Fix — second admin sees empty tables on shared OBO/Fabric agents** — on a shared-catalog `user_required` (Fabric/PowerBI/OBO) data source, a second admin with a valid delegated token saw zero tables and *Reload tables* didn't help, because the reload refreshed only the canonical catalog and never the caller's per-user overlay. The shared-catalog reload now also refreshes the caller's overlay so their tables appear immediately, without leaking the canonical catalog to disconnected callers.
- **Fix — race when deleting a data source during background indexing** — deleting a data source while a background connection indexer was re-syncing schema tables could reintroduce `datasource_tables` rows and trigger a foreign-key violation. The delete now re-clears the schema tables and retries until the indexer stops producing rows.
- **Fix — RTL alignment** in the Clarify tool.

## Version 0.0.410 (June 13, 2026)
- **Email the AI analyst (AI Mailbox)** — a new **Email** channel (alongside Slack/Teams/WhatsApp) lets people email the analyst and get answers back. It's IMAP/SMTP under the hood (provider-agnostic: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or any self-hosted server) with three auth modes — password/app-password, **Microsoft 365 app-only OAuth** (XOAUTH2), and **Google Workspace** (service account + domain-wide delegation). Inbound mail flows into a report, the agent replies in-thread (with a deep link back to the report), and **attachments are ingested as report files** (size-limited). Configure it from **Settings → Integrations**, with an inline **Test connection** before saving. IMAP is the optional upgrade that turns a send-only mailbox into a two-way channel.
- **Verify-first inbound identity** — by default a new sender must prove they control both the mailbox *and* a Dash account: first contact gets a **verification link** that, clicked while signed in, creates a trusted `email → user` binding (subsequent mail is trusted, like Slack/Teams). A spoofable `From` alone never grants data access. A pre-filter (DMARC/DKIM where available + domain allowlist + loop/auto-reply suppression) drops spoofers and noise first; registered-but-unlinked users, open invites, and signup-admitted domains each get the appropriate link rung, and everything else is **ignored + audited**. Auto-linking without verification is now an explicit, clearly-labeled opt-in.
- **Org SMTP transport** — a dedicated **SMTP Server** setting (separate from the AI Mailbox) becomes the org's transport for *system* mail — share notifications, scheduled-report/prompt results, verification links — overriding the global `dash-config` SMTP. The password is Fernet-encrypted at rest, no-auth/anonymous relays and a `validate_certs` toggle are supported, and there's a pre-save Test connection. Analyst mail always uses the mailbox; system mail never does — the two transports are kept strictly separate.
- **Scheduled schema auto-reindex** — connections can now periodically re-index themselves so tables stay fresh, with a per-connection toggle and a configurable interval (every N hours) in the connection detail modal; the last reindex error is surfaced inline. Scheduled reindexing is an enterprise feature.
- **Per-org license quotas** — licenses can now cap `max_users` and `max_agents` per organization (claims read from the license JWT; missing/negative means unlimited), enforced on user and agent creation.
- **Guaranteed data access on every dashboard** — building on 0.0.409's component ⓘ popover, an always-on, LLM-independent **DataInspector** (a floating "Data" button auto-mounted into the dashboard iframe) lists every visualization with the same **Data**/**Code** tabs, so even fully custom dashboards that never use the prebuilt cards still expose their backing data and query. A bare `<EChart>` outside a SectionCard now also carries the ⓘ popover. Suppressed in headless thumbnail/preview renders.
- **Instruction pill fix** — the report completion pill now includes **system-category** instructions (previously hidden), and partial/pill accepts are reflected correctly in the knowledge group.

## Version 0.0.409 (June 11, 2026)
- **Built-in info popover on dashboard components** — the prebuilt KPICard and SectionCard now carry a small ⓘ popover that surfaces a component's backing data. It opens on a **Data** tab (the actual visualization rows in a compact scrollable table) with a **Code** tab for the generating query, plus metadata above (source, type, row/column counts, active filters) and the viz id in a persistent footer. Both producers wire it automatically: deterministic "Add to Dashboard" codegen emits `viz={viz[N]}`, and the `create_artifact` / `edit_artifact` prompts instruct the model to do the same. The popover is **filter-aware** — when a component renders filtered rows it shows exactly what's on screen ("X of Y rows (filtered)") and only attributes filters that map onto the viz's columns, falling back to the full dataset otherwise.
- **Spark Connect data source** — new connector for querying Spark via the Spark Connect protocol, with partition metadata in the schema, a pre-flight `EXPLAIN` gate (partition-filter + scan-size guard), and a Spark icon in the data-source picker.
- **Scheduled tasks on specific days of the week** — recurring scheduled prompts can now target specific weekdays (e.g. Mon/Wed/Fri) instead of only daily/interval cadences, with localized day labels (including conventional Arabic/Hebrew day-of-week abbreviations).
- **Copy invite link always returns a usable link** — copying a pending member's link now rotates the token and resets the 14-day window if the invite has expired (or had no token), clearing the **Expired** badge; a still-valid link is returned unchanged so an already-emailed link isn't invalidated. No email is sent (that's **Resend**).

## Version 0.0.408 (June 10, 2026)
- **Roles, groups & quotas for not-yet-registered members** — admins can now assign RBAC roles, add to groups, and set a usage-policy (quota) on a *pending* invite (a user who hasn't signed up yet). These are stored against the invite and automatically materialized onto the user when they register, so access is correct on their very first request. Invites can also be pre-assigned at invite time (role/group/quota fields in the Invite modal), and removing a pending member cleans up its role/group/quota assignments.
- **Token-gated invites with expiry + resend** — invite links now carry a single-use token and expire after 14 days. On local/password sign-up the token is required: an invalid, expired, or missing token (for an invited email under closed signups) blocks account creation entirely. SSO/OIDC sign-up is unchanged (the IdP verifies identity, no token needed). A per-row **Resend** action (Members tab, requires `manage_members`) rotates the token, resets the 14-day window, and re-sends — the old link stops working immediately. Admins can also fetch a pending invite's link via an admin-only endpoint (handy when SMTP is off). Pending rows show an **Expired** status when the window lapses.
- **Reliable, human invite & welcome emails** — the invite email is now sent synchronously with retries + a per-attempt timeout (no more silent fire-and-forget), and the outcome (`sent` / `failed` / `skipped_no_smtp`) is surfaced to the admin. New users get a plain-text **welcome email** summarizing the agents (data sources) they can access with a link in. Copy is plain-text and human (no buttons), signed "Dash".
- **Members tab overhaul** — compact, cleaner table; checkbox selection with **bulk actions** (add role, add to group, remove); client-side **pagination**; row **Resend**; the **Actions column is frozen** to the right while the wide table scrolls; borderless inline Role/Quota selects; consistent role-name casing; collapsed group chips ("+N"); wider Note column with tooltip. The **Groups** and **Quotas** tabs now share the same compact styling.
- **Private data sources by default (#364)** — newly created data sources / agents are now private by default (`is_public = false`); only explicitly-added members (and admins) can see them unless opted public. Adding a member to a data source now sends a **delayed "you've been added" email** (5-minute delay, re-validated at send time so an undone add never mails, claimed so exactly one worker sends).
- **MCP search (#366)** — `search_mcps` supports wildcard queries (list everything) and ships a clearer tool description.

## Version 0.0.407 (June 9, 2026)
- Fix "Shared with me" reports linking to the owner's `/reports/:id` page (which renders blank for non-owners) — they now open the read-only shared conversation view at `/c/:token`. Shared reports without a share token are no longer clickable.

## Version 0.0.406 (June 9, 2026)
- SQL Server connections can now pass extra ODBC keywords (e.g. `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly` to route to a read-only Always On replica) via a new optional **Additional Connection Parameters** key-value editor in the connect form. Security-sensitive keys (Encrypt, credentials, driver, server, database) cannot be overridden, and existing connections are unchanged.

## Version 0.0.405 (June 9, 2026)
- QVD date/timestamp/time fields now load as real DATE/TIMESTAMP/TIME columns instead of raw Excel-style serial numbers, so they filter, sort, and group as dates

## Version 0.0.404 (June 8, 2026)
- Fix duplicate scheduled emails/reports under multi-worker/replica deployments — each cron fire is now claimed once via a DB-backed lock so exactly one worker runs it (also covers cache warmups, payload purge, and LDAP sync)
- License expiry now takes effect without a restart, plus a global expiry-countdown banner and a redesigned license settings page (tier/expiry details, expiring-soon and expired states, renew CTA)
- Small (<10 row) create_data results are no longer sent to Slack/Teams and are auto-collapsed in the report UI, since the agent's text already states the values
- Manage an agent's primary instruction from the agent page: edit, replace with an existing instruction, or start a training session
- Many-series (>8) line/bar/area charts now use a scrollable vertical legend docked on the right instead of an overflowing horizontal one
- Data-source and agent pickers grow to fit long names instead of truncating
- Fix report auto-title silently not saving (mostly on Postgres) when the background task outlived its DB session

## Version 0.0.403 (June 8, 2026)
- **Teams** — a reused Teams 1:1 conversation report (up to 5 days old) now re-syncs its data sources to the user's current access on each message, so grants appear and revocations disappear without waiting out the window.
- **UI** — the data-source members panel relabels the management column to "Management role" and the empty state to "Query only" (was "None"), and clarifies that everyone listed can query the agent and that Remove is what revokes access.

## Version 0.0.402 (June 8, 2026)
- Admin query-identity toggle for delegated (Entra ID / Microsoft Fabric OBO) connections — admins/owners can now choose, per connection, to run queries as the **service account** (the connection's principal) or as **themselves** (their own delegated/OBO token), from the connection detail modal. Default is "Me": the service principal is never used silently for an admin's interactive queries — if they have no personal token yet, the query is blocked and the UI prompts them to Connect. The selection is persisted per (user, connection) and applied consistently across the tables selector (overlay vs shared catalog), the agent's schema context, and query execution (inspect/create data).

## Version 0.0.401 (June 7, 2026)
- Agent run activity chart in /monitoring diagnosis — daily agent executions bucketed by status (success/error) with click-to-filter by day, backed by a new diagnosis timeseries endpoint
- Add a `dash` MCP skill template documenting the core analysis workflow (create report, run tracked queries, build dashboards) for use with the Dash MCP connector
- MCP error handling: tool-level MCP failures (`isError`) now surface the server's real error message instead of `None`, so the agent can correct course instead of retrying blindly — and failed MCP calls no longer show a misleading green ✓ in the trace
- MCP planner context: the `execute_mcp` digest now echoes which underlying tool was called and with what arguments (plus the real error on failure), so the planner stops looping through call variants
- MCP tool UI: the tool card now shows the actual command/input invoked (tool + arguments for `execute_mcp`, query for `search_mcps`, code for `write_csv`), not just the result

## Version 0.0.400 (June 7, 2026)
- Teradata Vantage data source integration — connect Teradata as a data source, with sample queries included in the client description
- Generated-code reuse via `load_step`/`load_entity` — the planner and coder now prefer loading a prior step's results over rebuilding from scratch, reducing redundant code generation
- Fix LLM token-usage undercount in /monitoring (no added latency)

## Version 0.0.399 (June 7, 2026)
- Fix MCP tool results aborting the agent run: materializing a large/tabular MCP result to a file linked it to the report before the file's id was assigned, causing a foreign-key violation that poisoned the shared transaction (surfaced as "transaction is aborted" / agent execution errors). File linking now happens after the id is set and inside a savepoint, so a materialization failure degrades gracefully instead of failing the whole run. Also restores CSV preview generation, which was silently broken.

## Version 0.0.398 (June 6, 2026)
- Inbound webhooks for reports — connect GitHub, Jira, or any other service (Generic catch-all) so external events flow into a report's chat. Configure them from the report Summary tab; each report's webhook count shows in the reports list.
  - Per-webhook signing key with three verification modes: token header (default — a shared secret, works with Jira Cloud and most legacy systems), HMAC signatures (GitHub-native or Dash's own scheme), and URL token (for senders that can only POST). Per-org delivery dedup and rate limiting, plus a one-time URL + key reveal on create/rotate.
  - Optional small-model AI classifier decides whether an event warrants a response — guided by an optional per-webhook prompt plus your org instructions and the report's conversation — and, when it acts, authors the task the agent runs. The event entry shows a live 👀 (working) → ✅ (done) status; declined events are marked "no action needed".
  - Gated org-wide by the new "Report Webhooks" setting (on by default), with org limits for max webhooks and delivery rate.

## Version 0.0.396 (June 6, 2026)
- Star (favorite) reports — starred reports are pinned to the top of /reports. Starring is per-user, so each person keeps their own favorites, and you can star reports shared with you read-only

## Version 0.0.395 (June 6, 2026)
- Native web search for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI (provider-executed, via the Responses API) — opt-in per provider and gated by the org Web Fetch setting, with a live "Searching the web" step (rendered as a tool with the query + cited sources) and source citations

## Version 0.0.394 (June 6, 2026)
- Fix scheduled tasks running one weekday late (cron day-of-week off-by-one vs the scheduler), and the schedule editor showing the wrong day
- Conversation history now records scheduled-task and email actions (so the assistant can dedupe schedules, cancel the right task, and recall what it emailed)

## Version 0.0.393 (June 6, 2026)
- Scheduled tasks: ask the agent to run something on a recurring schedule (e.g. "email me once a week about ...") — new create/cancel scheduled-task tools, reusing the existing scheduled-prompt UI
